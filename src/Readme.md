# Landify Website

This is a responsive website for "Landify," designed using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a fixed, scroll-sensitive navbar that adapts to user interaction by changing its style, shrinking on scroll, and aligning content dynamically.

## Features

- **Responsive Navbar**: The navbar remains fixed at the top of the screen when scrolling, and shrinks in width and adjusts its alignment. The logo text hides, and the navbar content is centered when scrolling.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking on the links allows smooth navigation to different sections of the page.
- **Button Actions**: Buttons are styled to be visually appealing and interactive.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling for the elements.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic functionality for the scroll-based navbar effects and smooth scrolling.
